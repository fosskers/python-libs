ABOUT PYTHON-LIBS
-----------------
These are my personal python libraries that I use for various tasks.
The libraries are as follows:

*Currently Available*
numworks - Supplies many general purpose math-solving functions.
listhelp - Supplies a number of common functions that work on lists which
           are unavailable in the standard library. 
           e.g.: scramble()  # Puts the elements of a list into a random order.
pghelp   - Supplies functions that can aid in performing tasks done in a 
	   pygame game.
strhelp  - Supplies some simple string manipulation functions.
funchelp - Supplies some functions that mimic their Haskell counterparts.
syshelp  - Simplifies common programming patterns using the sys library.
filehelp - Supplies functions that perform certain tasks on files.
primes   - Supplies functions for calculating and dealing with prime numbers.
decorum  - Supplies some handy decorators for various tasks.

INSTALLING PYTHON-LIBS
----------------------
Just add the directory where you place the source files to your pythonpath.
To do this, add the following to your .bash_profile (mac) or .bashrc (Linux).

export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:~/path/to/python-libs

Do this, and you will be able to import any of these libraries from
any location on your computer.
